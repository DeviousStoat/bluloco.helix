# Bluloco.helix

Port of the [bluloco.nvim](https://github.com/uloco/bluloco.nvim) theme which is itself a port of the [Bluloco Light](https://github.com/uloco/theme-bluloco-light) and [Blueloco Dark](https://github.com/uloco/theme-bluloco-dark) themes for Visual Studio Code.

DISCLAIMER: I am not the original author of these themes, I simply tried my best to port them to be used easily in Helix. If you like them like I do, give a shoutout to the original themes listed above.

## Installation

Simply copy `bluloco_dark.toml` and/or `bluloco_light.toml` files in your `helix/themes` directory and set the theme to `bluloco_dark` or `bluloco_light` in your editor config.
